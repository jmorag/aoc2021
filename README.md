# Advent of code 2021

Designed to be run at the repl. Each module has a `part1` and `part2` function that outputs the answer. There's also some cool template haskell in [AOCUtils](https://github.com/jmorag/aoc2021/blob/b70e691e1c2f7b47d1bea7c46dc4f057dacf34c9/src/AOCUtils.hs#L24-L31) that embeds test cases and input files as bytestrings from the `data` folder into the current module.
